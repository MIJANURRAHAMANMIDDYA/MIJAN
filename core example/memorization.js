//Memoization is a programming technique which attempts to increase a functionâ€™s performance by
// caching its previously computed results. Because JavaScript objects behave like associative arrays, 
//they are ideal candidates to act as caches. Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters
// are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function.  However, 
//if the data is not cached, then the function is executed, and the result is added to the cache.

        return 1

    return memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo)
